Hi!
=================

I made this page using the [Draggabilly](https://github.com/desandro/draggabilly) JS library and jQuery. I created the moving peach function by messing with a jsfiddle I found on this [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10385950/how-to-get-a-div-to-randomly-move-around-a-page-using-jquery-or-css/10386178) page. 

The marquee trick was something I learned in the [SuperHi Advanced CSS + JS](https://www.superhi.com/courses/advanced-css-and-javascript) course.

I made this project because it involved my three favorite things: photoshop, TimothÃ©e, and coding ðŸ–¤ Pls enjoy.
